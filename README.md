# Char_Level_Machine_Translation_Keras

Character Level Translation from MinangKabau to Indonesian language

**Dataset** - I have used word to word dictionary dataset to do character level machine translation. Dataset consist of Minangkabau-Indonesian 14000 dictionary word pairs. Both of
these languages can be similar in writing but their pronounciation is different.


**Models**

 **Char Level LSTM** - Encoder LSTM + Decoder LSTM

 **Char Level BiLSTM** - Encoder LSTM + Decoder BiLSTM

 **Byte pair Encoding + BiLSTM** 

 **Char Level Transformers** - Transformers with Multi-Head Attention Mechanism.

Feel free to raise an issue if you face difficulty to understand how these models are applied.
